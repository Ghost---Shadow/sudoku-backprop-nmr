> Neural optimization meets nuclear magnetic resonance: Solving constraint satisfaction problems through the lens of quantum relaxation dynamics.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a novel approach to Sudoku solving using neural optimization with a unique twist - interpreting the solving process as a **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiment**. By treating unknown cells as "nuclear spins" and optimization as "magnetic relaxation," we can visualize and analyze the solving dynamics through Free Induction Decay (FID) signals and frequency spectra.

## Key Innovation

- **üß≤ Bistable Loss Function**: Creates energy minima at 0 and 1, mimicking magnetic field alignment
- **üì° FID Signal Generation**: Real-time monitoring of "transverse magnetization" during optimization  
- **üî¨ Spectral Analysis**: FFT-based frequency domain analysis reveals optimization characteristics
- **‚ö° Vectorized Constraints**: Efficient exclusion loss implementation for Sudoku rules

## Files

- `backprop_solve.py` - Original solver with bistable + exclusion loss functions
- `backprop_solve_softmax.py` - Simplified softmax-only version (combines both loss functions)
- `sudoku_nmr_analysis.png` - Generated spectroscopy plots showing FID decay and frequency spectrum

## Physics-Optimization Analogy

| NMR Concept | Sudoku Implementation | Purpose |
|-------------|----------------------|---------|
| Nuclear spins | Cell probability distributions | Individual quantum states |
| Magnetic field (B‚ÇÄ) | Bistable loss `x¬≤(x-1)¬≤` | Drive toward binary states |
| RF pulse | Uniform initialization | Excitation from equilibrium |
| T‚ÇÅ relaxation | Loss minimization | Energy dissipation |
| T‚ÇÇ relaxation | Probability sharpening | Decoherence/decision making |
| FID signal | Uncertainty measure | Transverse magnetization |
| Frequency spectrum | Optimization dynamics | Characteristic time scales |

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd sudoku-nmr

# Install dependencies
pip install torch numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

**Original Version (Bistable + Exclusion):**
```bash
python backprop_solve.py
```

**Simplified Softmax Version:**
```bash
python backprop_solve_softmax.py
```

Both scripts will:
1. üß≤ Initialize the "NMR spectrometer" 
2. üì° Apply initial "RF pulse" (uniform probability distribution)
3. üî¨ Record FID signals during optimization
4. üìä Generate spectroscopic analysis plots
5. üíæ Save results to `sudoku_nmr_analysis.png`

## Algorithm Details

### Neural Architecture
```
Grid: 9√ó9√ó9 tensor (position √ó position √ó number_probability)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Known cells: Fixed one-hot vectors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Unknown cells: Learnable probability distributions  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Gradient masking: Only unknown cells participate in optimization
```

### Loss Functions

#### Original Approach (`backprop_solve.py`)

**Bistable Loss** (Magnetic Field)
```python
def bistable_loss(x):
    return (x¬≤ * (x-1)¬≤).mean()
```

**Exclusion Loss** (Spin Coupling)
```python
# Vectorized constraint enforcement
row_loss = Œ£(Œ£(probs[row, :, number]) - 1)¬≤
col_loss = Œ£(Œ£(probs[:, col, number]) - 1)¬≤  
box_loss = Œ£(Œ£(probs[box, number]) - 1)¬≤
```

#### Softmax Approach (`backprop_solve_softmax.py`)

**Combined Softmax Loss** (Unified Constraints)
```python
def exclusion_loss(grid_logits):
    # Softmax inherently combines bistable + exclusion behavior:
    # - Entropy minimization ‚Üí drives toward peaked states (bistable effect)
    # - Normalization per constraint group ‚Üí ensures sum=1 (exclusion effect)
    
    row_entropy = entropy(softmax(grid_logits, dim=1))
    col_entropy = entropy(softmax(grid_logits, dim=0)) 
    box_entropy = entropy(softmax(box_logits, dim=box_dim))
    
    return row_entropy + col_entropy + box_entropy  # Always >= 0
```

### FID Signal Calculation
```python
# Uncertainty as transverse magnetization
uncertainty = (1.0 - max_probs) / (1.0 - 1/9)
phases = (preferred_numbers / 9.0) * 2œÄ

# Complex FID signal
real = uncertainty * cos(phases)
imag = uncertainty * sin(phases)
magnitude = ‚àö(real¬≤ + imag¬≤)
```

### Multiple Puzzle Analysis
Each Sudoku puzzle exhibits unique **spectral fingerprints** based on:
- Initial constraint density
- Symmetry properties  
- Solution pathway complexity
- Constraint interaction patterns

## Scientific Insights

1. **Neural optimization naturally exhibits relaxation dynamics** similar to quantum systems
2. **Constraint satisfaction can be viewed as magnetic resonance experiments**
3. **Different puzzles show unique spectral signatures** revealing their structural properties
4. **FID analysis provides insight into optimization landscape quality**
5. **Learning rate controls relaxation time scales** like magnetic field strength

## Applications

- **üß© Constraint Satisfaction**: General CSP solving with physical intuition
- **üî¨ Optimization Analysis**: Understanding convergence through spectral properties
- **üì° Neural Dynamics**: Studying training dynamics as physical processes
- **üéØ Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using relaxation times to guide parameter selection

## Future Directions

- **Multi-pulse sequences**: Implementing spin echo and inversion recovery
- **2D NMR spectroscopy**: Cross-correlation analysis between constraints
- **Relaxometry**: Systematic study of T‚ÇÅ/T‚ÇÇ times vs puzzle complexity
- **Chemical shift analysis**: Investigating constraint "environments"

## Theory

The fundamental insight is that neural optimization of discrete constraint problems naturally exhibits quantum relaxation dynamics. 

**Original Approach**: The bistable loss creates potential wells analogous to nuclear spin states, while constraint coupling mimics magnetic field interactions.

**Softmax Approach**: Softmax naturally combines both effects - entropy minimization drives toward peaked states (bistable effect) while normalization per constraint group ensures sum-to-1 constraints (exclusion effect). This unified approach is mathematically cleaner and naturally bounded at zero.

Both approaches allow us to:

1. **Visualize optimization** as physical relaxation processes
2. **Analyze convergence** through established NMR theory
3. **Understand landscapes** via spectroscopic signatures
4. **Design better solvers** inspired by magnetic resonance techniques
